Summary
=======

ROS wrapper for the [Stage][] simulator. Requires that Stage 4.1 is installed in
*/opt/stage*.

This package exposes only a subset of Stage's functionality via ROS.
Specifically, it supports only single-robot simulations. The Stage models that
are present in the simulated world are mapped to the corresponding ROS topics.

Nodes
=====

stage
-----

It is necessary to set the `/use_sim_time` parameter to __true__  *before*
starting the node. If this has not been done, the static transforms between
robot components will not be published.

### Subscribed topics

* `cmd_vel` (*geometry_msgs/Twist*)  
  velocity commands to control the robot

### Published topics

* `odom` (*nav_msgs/Odometry*)  
  odometry data from the robot

* `gt` (*nav_msgs/Odometry*)  
  ground truth position of the robot

* `scan_front` (*sensor_msgs/LaserScan*)  
  scans from the front laser

* `scan_rear` (*sensor_msgs/LaserScan*)  
  scans from the rear laser

* `sonar_pioneer` (*amr_msgs/Ranges*)  
  range readings from the pioneer sonar ring

* `sonar_braitenberg` (*amr_msgs/Ranges*)  
  range readings from the pair of braitenberg sonars

Note: laser and sonar topics are optional and depend on the availability of the
corresponding devices.

### Parameters

* `~world_file` (default: /opt/stage/share/stage/worlds/simple.world)  
  world description file

* `~window_width` (default: 400)  
  width of the Stage's GUI window

* `~window_height` (default: 300)  
  height of the Stage's GUI window

* `~headless` (default: false)  
  run Stage node without GUI window

* `~world_width`  
  width of the currently loaded world, set by the node during startup

* `~world_height`  
  height of the currently loaded world, set by the node during startup

### Dynamically reconfigurable parameters

Use the [rqt_reconfigure][] GUI to update these parameters in runtime:

* `~simulation_speed` (default: 10)  
  frequency of the simulation main loop (in Hz)

### Services provided

* `get_rangers` (*amr_srvs/GetRangers*)  
  returns the list of available ranger devices and their states (on/off)

* `switch_ranger` (*amr_srvs/SwitchRanger*)  
  turn on/off a particular ranger device

ranges_republisher
------------------

### Subscribed topics

* `ranges_in` (*amr_msgs/Ranges*)  
  input range readings, grouped in a single message

### Published topics

* `ranges_out` (*sensor_msgs/Range*)  
  output range readings, one reading per message

### Parameters

* `~filter_ids` (default: none)  
  comma-separated list of ids of the individual sonars that have to be
  republished; if not set then all readings are republished
