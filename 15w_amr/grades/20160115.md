On launch there are problems noted: the explorer chaotically sends new goals one after another without them being reached. The reason is that once the goal is sent, there is no waiting for the path execution. Either something like ```self._execute_path_client.wait_for_result(rospy.Duration(60.0))``` could be used or other ways some time should be left for the path motion could be executed. 

Unfortunately, uproper usage of the path executor service hinders the functioning the most. In general, the infrastructure is not working properly either, the output is full of path planner exceptions thrown.

The exploration requires more tweaking in order to allow all the nodes work together. The algorithm is unable to explore the map in current implementation.
