Clear code, nice solution. The only remark:

* The idea of mismatch tolerance is to allow some scans to be discarded not to spoil the others. It is not necessary to return 0 (zero out the likelihood) when the mismatches exceed allowed number. In this case it is better to allow the bad mismatches be present and allow them to lower the likelihood naturally.
