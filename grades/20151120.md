Great job, some problems were spotted though.

~~The __skip\_unreachable__ parameter is not supported. It can be found in the Path Goal message as ```executePathGoal.skip_unreachable```. The code should abort path execution on unreachable pose in the path once __skip\_unreachable__ is __False__. Also the walfollower is not consistent in detecting unreachable goals, binary was used for testing.~~

The safer way to read *rospy.get_param('param', defaultvalue)* is by adding a default value (what if launch param is missing?)

Upd: Skip unreachibility feature present as demonstrated in the lab class.
