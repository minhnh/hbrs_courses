Great job!

The only problem is that the cone length should be computed as registered\_range + uncertainty. If not, some cells further will not get occupancy increment, but they should be processed since they are within range **registered\_range +- uncertainty**.
This also would fill more wall cells for readings hitting obstacles. (Also this prevents 0 length cones. Your implementation reveals this problem with the cone implementation which is to be fixed).

The normalization is not correct: the temp occupancy value is written to the \_map\_occupied and then this value is normalized. It should be: store temp occupancy elswhere, in the second pass divide if by occupancy sum and then add to the \_map\_occupied using the merging formula. In your case you just overwrite the current_occupancy which is needed in the normalization step once again.
