\section{Theoretical questions}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{What is a solution for a constraint satisfaction problem?}\\
            A solution for a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a state in
            which all variables are assigned and no constraint is violated.
        \item \emph{What are the components of a constraint satisfaction problem?}\\
            A constraint satisfaction problem consists of the variables, the
            domain of these variables, and a set of constraints on these variables.
        \item \emph{What is a constraint and how is it represented?}\\
            A constraint specifies the conditions variables must conform to be a
            solution. A constraint can concern value of a single variable (unary)
            or values of a group of variables. A constraint can be absolute or
            by preference. A constraint operated on a discrete, finite domain
            can be represented by enumerating all possible values or combination
            of values.
        \item \emph{What is a constraint graph?}\\
            A constraint graph is a map representation of a binary CSP (where a
            constraint applies to at most two variables). In a constraint graph,
            each node represents a variable, and each edge represents a constraint.
        \item \emph{What are discrete variables and how are they divided?}
        \item \emph{What is preference?}
        \item \emph{What is a successor function?}
        \item \emph{What is constraint propagation?}
        \item \emph{What is arc-consistency?}
        \item \emph{What is Backtracking Search?}
    \end{itemize}

\section{Sudoku puzzle}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Variables: all unknown cells in the 9-by-9 puzzle

	\item Domain: $\{1-9\}$

    \item Constraints
    \begin{itemize}
        \item No same value on a row
        \item No same value in a column
        \item The puzzle is divided into 9 cell groups, each of size 3-by-3. The
        third constraint is no same value in any of these groups.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
