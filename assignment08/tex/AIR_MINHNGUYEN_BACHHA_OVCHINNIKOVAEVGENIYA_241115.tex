\section{Theoretical questions}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{What is a solution for a constraint satisfaction problem?}\\
            A solution for a constraint satisfaction problem is a state in which
            all variables are assigned and no constraint is violated.
        \item \emph{What are the components of a constraint satisfaction problem?}
            A constraint satisfaction problem consists of the variables, the
            domain of these variables, and a set of constraints that the values
            assigned to the variables must conform.
        \item \emph{What is a constraint and how is it represented?}
        \item \emph{What is a constraint graph?}
        \item \emph{What are discrete variables and how are they divided?}
        \item \emph{What is preference?}
        \item \emph{What is a successor function?}
        \item \emph{What is constraint propagation?}
        \item \emph{What is arc-consistency?}
        \item \emph{What is Backtracking Search?}
