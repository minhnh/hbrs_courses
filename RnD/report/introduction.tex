\section{Introduction}

Motivation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In an aging society, exercising is an important factor to ensure a long and healthy life.
    \item This project will address the problem of learning user-specific heart rate response models for the use in (novel) smart training devices.
    \item Heart rates play an important role in improving the efficiency of physical training, but the data is highly individual-specific. The ability to reliably predicting heart rates from exercise workload can therefore allow for personalized training sessions. Model based planning, control and advanced monitoring techniques can also be built on top of such heart rate models. Finally, machine learning techniques allow learning non-linear models based on the recorded workload and environmental data, as well as adaptation to the environments through introducing additional variables such as track elevation and inclination.
