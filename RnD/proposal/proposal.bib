  Abstract                 = {The aim of this paper is to study the human Heart Rate (HR) response during walking, cycling and rowing exercises using linear time varying (LTV) models. We used the frequency of exercise locomotion as the input to the model. This frequency characterizes the stride rate, cadence rate and strokes rate of the walking, cycling and rowing exercises respectively. The time varying parameters in the LTV models were estimated by the Kalman Filter (KF). The results in this study demonstrate that HR responses to these exercises exhibit some degree of time varying nature.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The system of heart rate/cycling power can be modeled through a nonlinear Hammerstein \{ARX\} model with uncertainties. Therefore, we investigate these models via the so-called Takagi-Sugeno (TS) framework. \{TS\} models belong to the family of quasi-LPV and allow an exact representation of the nonlinear system. The goal of the paper is to show that an efficient output feedback control can be achieved via specific Lyapunov functions. Results from real-time application show the interest of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Given two states A and B such that individuals in state A have mutually exclusive probabilities, possibly dependent on the time spent in state A, of leaving that state because of (i) death, or (ii) passage to state B, what is the probability of an individual passing to state B and dying there within a given period? This problem has been of great interest and importance to actuaries for over 100 years and the solutions of their professional contemporaries have appeared in their textbooks. Twentyâ€“five years ago statisticians felicitously named the technique the theory of competing risks (Neyman, 1950) and developed the formulae ab initio in the framework of Markov processes. Consideration of the problem started with Daniel Bernoulli's smallpox mathematics and continued with pension fund financing involving the payment of annuities to invalid lives. Most of the currently accepted techniques were developed during the nineteenth century. This article reviews the history both of actuarial and statistical contributions to the literature.},
