  Abstract                 = { In performing a manipulation task, humans tend to adopt arm postures that most effectively utilize the motion and strength capabilities of the arm. Selecting arm postures that are compatible with the task requirements has become almost instinctive to humans. By mimicking this approach in robotic manipulation, we can exploit the full capability of a manipu lator in performing a task. An index is proposed for measur ing the compatibility of manipulator postures with respect to a generalized task description. The manipulator is viewed as a mechanical transformer, with joint space velocity and force as input and task space velocity and force as output. Optimi zation of the index corresponds to matching the velocity and force transmission characteristics to the task requirements. The applications of this index to manipulator redundancy utilization and workspace design are also discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Regarding the dexterousness measure of robot manipulators, two geometric tools, manipulability ellipsoids and manipulability polytopes, are examined and compared with each other. Even though the manipulability ellipsoid approach is the most widely used techniques, it is shown that the manipulability ellipsoid does not transform the exact joint velocity constraints into task space and so may fail to give exact dexterousness measure and optimal direction of motion in task space. After showing that the polytope approach can handle such problems, we propose a practical polytope method which can be applied to general 6-dimensional task space. The relation between manipulability ellipsoids and manipulability polytopes are also explored for a redundant case as well as nonredundant case},
