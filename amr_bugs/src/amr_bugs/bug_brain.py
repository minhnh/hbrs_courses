#=============================== YOUR CODE HERE ===============================
# Instructions: complete the currently empty BugBrain class. A new instance of
#               this class will be created for each new move_to command. The
#               constructor receives the goal specification and the mode of
#               wallfollowing (left (0) or right (1)) that is currently in use.
#               All the remaining functions receive the current position and
#               orientation of the robot.
#
# Hint: you can create a class member variable at any place in your code (not
#       only in __init__) by assigning a value to it, e.g.:
#
#           self.some_member_variable = 2012
#
# Hint: you could use the 'planar' library to avoid implementing geometrical
#       functions that check the distance between a point and a line, or any
#       other helper functions that you need. To use its classes add the
#       following import statements on top of the file:
#
#            from planar import Point, Vec2
#            from planar.c import Line
#            from math import degrees
#
#       As discussed in the lab class, you will need to install the library by
#       executing `sudo pip install planar` in the terminal.
#
# Hint: all the member variables whose names start with 'wp_' (which stands for
#       'waypoint') will be automagically visualized in RViz as points of
#       different colors. Similarly, all the member variables whose names
#       start with 'ln_' (which stands for 'line') will be visualized as lines
#       in RViz. The only restriction is that the objects stored in these
#       variables should indeed be points and lines.
#       The valid points are:
#
#           self.wp_one = (1, 2)
#           self.wp_two = [1, 2]
#           self.wp_three = Point(x, y) # if you are using 'planar'
#
#       The valid lines are (assuming that p1 and p2 are valid points):
#
#           self.ln_one = (p1, p2)
#           self.ln_two = [p1, p2]
#           self.ln_three = Line.from_points([p1, p2]) # if you are using 'planar'
